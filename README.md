# Machine_learning_model_from_scratch
Built a classification machine learning model from scratch without using any libraries to explain the various forward and backward propagation of the neural network.
It supports creation of multiple layers to handle non-linear transition of neural training and gives descent accuracy due to proper estimation and calculation of minimal error by our Stochastic Gradient Descent formulation.
An example of mobile price classification is taken and the corresponding dataset is taken from kaggle just for elaboration of proper functioning of the program created and each section is elaborated briefly.
